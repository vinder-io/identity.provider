# Errors Reference

This document provides a comprehensive catalog of error codes, messages, and their meanings within the system. It is intended to help developers, testers, and support teams quickly understand the possible errors that may occur, the scenarios in which they arise, and guidance on how to handle or resolve them.

Each error entry includes:  
- A unique error code for easy identification  
- A clear description of the error  
- Contextual information about when and why the error might occur
